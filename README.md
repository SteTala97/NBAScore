## About this work:

An online dashboard developped with React that shows various information about the NBA, like statistics about games searched by date, teams, rankings, players etc by connecting to an external [API service](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba). 

A more detailed description can be found in the docs [docs/GeneralDoc.md](https://github.com/SteTala97/NBAScore/blob/main/docs/GeneralDoc.md) - unfortunately all the documents are only available in italian.
